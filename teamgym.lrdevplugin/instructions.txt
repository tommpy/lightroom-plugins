It largely comes down to how many you have in a category. 

They can be grouped by age group or competition level. I tend to go by age first then competition level

The order within the groups is floor - tumble - trampet. We used to do it by random draw but I now just select the order to space out teams from the same club so that their coaching team can operate multiple teams with just two coaches

What’s the rule if you don’t have a multiple of 3 teams?

And is that an official thing for comps or is it a convention that people tend to stick to?

7 is the ideal group size. Less than 5 doesn't really work. 9 is a push.

Ahh ok, so you flip the pairs for the second lot if it’s even

What about with floor?

You lay the numbers across floor, tumble and trampet unless it's divisible by 3
